    value: 'With regard to the usual and normal charge for fees received from a federal
      candidate on Schedule A supporting Line 15, the RNC charges fair market value
      for services it provides.  Prices are intended to recover the cost for providing
      the service.  The services reported on this schedule for which the RNC received
      payment were not services of a nature which is unique to the RNC.  Services
      of this type are common in the business community and as such, the RNC compares
      and sets the price charged to prices available from other commercial sources.
